API Service Marketplace
-------------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:coachchuckff` `author:unclejim21`

This NIP defines `kind:31402` (a _parameterized replaceable event_) for broadcasting API services, endpoints and their costs in mSats. And `kind:1402` to post reviews of said services. API services are offered ala carte to be paid via [L402s](https://docs.lightning.engineering/the-lightning-network/l402)

API service providers will issue a `kind:31402` event as an API service offering. Clients can fetch `service` tag offerings, call their endpoints, and pay per use. Creating an API service marketplace.

## Protocol flow

1. API Service provider creates and hosts API service offerings, they then issue a `kind:31402` event for each `service`
2. Client fetches API offerings by `service` tag.
3. Client chooses a provider(s) and calls their `endpoint` with all of their parameters needed for their request.
4. The service provider should validate their request and return a lightning invoice with a `successAction` url.
   1. The `successAction` url should be uniquely ID'd with the invoice hash.
   2.  The `successAction` url should have two callable endpoints: 
       1.  `check_payment` - this should persist always as a proof of payment
       2.  `get_result` - this should persist until the client has retireved the result
5. The client will poll the `successAction`'s `get_results` endpoint until the service provider has posted the result(s).
6. The client can then post a `kind:1402` review of the service, providing the `invoice_hash` so that anyone can re-create the `successAction`'s `check_payment` url and obtain the proof of payment.

## Server Functions
Each `kind:31402`'s endpoint should feild three functions. `create_invoice`, `check_payment`, and `get_results`. For the following sections assume we are given the following `endpoint`: `https://example.api/chat/`

### Create Invoice

Initally, the client will make a POST request to the `endpoint` with all of their parameters needed for the request in the body.

This service provider will implicitly call the `create_invoice` function and do the following: 

1. Validate their API request
2. Issue a lightning invoice

Within the lightning invoice should be a `successAction` url formatted as so:

`<endpoint>/<invoice_hash>/`

for example: 

`https://example.api/chat/<invoice_hash>/`

From here the service provider can either listen and execute their API request "on-payment" or wait until the client calls `check_payment` or `get_results`.

### Check Payment

Once the client has gotten the `successAction` url, they can append `check_payment` and submit a GET request. The service provider will respond with json object with information about the status of the payment.

GET `https://example.api/chat/<invoice_hash>/check_payment`

```json
    Response: {
        "paid": "true",
        "amount": "5000",
        "timestamp": "1675642635"
    }
```

This is to be used as a proof of payment. The service provider should keep this endpoint alive indefinately.

### Get Results

Once the client has gotten the `successAction` url, they can append `get_results` and submit a GET request. The service provider should respond in one of three ways:

1. Passthrough - the service provider returns the results of the API as if it was coming from the product itself
2. Not Ready - the service provider returns a status that indicates the results are not ready yet
3. 402 - the service provider should respond with a 402 error if they client has not paid yet

The service provider should keep the resulting data persistent until after the client has used it.

## Event Reference and Examples

### Format ( Service Tag )

The `service` tag should simply be the full name of the API service provided. To standardize the offerings, the following should be followed for posting and parsing.

- All letters should be UPPER CASE.
- Spaces, Hyphens, Underscores should be removed.
- Names should be spelled out completely
  
For example, "Chat-GPT3.5", should result in "CHATGPT3.5" See **Sample Services**.

### Offering Event

`kind:31402`

`.content` should be empty.

For the date of the last update the `.created_at` field should be used.

`.tag` MUST include the following:

- `service`, the service offered, see **Format ( Service Tag )**
- `d`, following **parameterized replaceable events** in [NIP-01](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/01.md), this tag allows this event to be replaceable. It should be formatted as such: `<pubkey><service>`
- `amount`, the cost in _millisats_ for the API service. This can be 0 for a free service.
- `endpoint`, the API endpoint.
- `docs`, the documentation url to provide context to what the endpoint is expecting.
- `status`, status of the service `UP`|`DOWN`|`CLOSED`.
- `published_at`, for the timestamp in unix seconds (stringified) of the first time the service was posted

### Service Review Event

`kind:1402`

`.content` the review left by the client.

`.tag` MUST include the following:

- `e`, id of the service offering event.
- `did_succeed`, `true` | `false`
- `invoice_hash`, in order to call GET `<endpoint>/<invoice_hash>/check_payment` for a proof of payment

### Safey

It is not manditory, but to raise the barrier to entry, clients should screen service provider's NIP-05 identifier. The domain used in their NIP-05, should be the same domain used for their endpoint.

Clients may wish to create a whitelist of trusted service providers once tested.

Clients may wish to randomly test the reviews for a given service to ensure 

### Example Service Event

```json
{
  "kind": 31402,
  "created_at": 1675642635, // Changes on update
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["service", "CHATGPT4"]
    ["d", "<pubkey>CHATGPT4"],
    ["amount", "5000"] //mSats
    ["endpoint", "https://..."],
    ["docs", "https://..."],
    ["status", "UP"], //UP | DOWN | CLOSED
    ["published_at", 1675642635], // Set on published
  ],
  "pubkey": "...",
  "id": "..."
}
```

### Example Review Event

```json
{
  "kind": 1402,
  "created_at": 1675642635, // Changes on update
  "content": "This service worked great!",
  "tags": [
    ["e", "<service id>"],
    ["invoice_hash", "..."]
  ],
  "pubkey": "...",
  "id": "..."
}
```

### Sample Services

| Service            |
| ------------------ |
| `CHATGPT4`         |
| `CHATGPT3.5`       |
| `DALLE`            |
| `STABLEDIFFUSION`  |
| `WHISPER`          |

### Problems
- No data integrety - service providers can store/redistrubte any data passed to them
- Service providers could take payment and never return the product
