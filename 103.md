API Service Marketplace
-------------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:coachchuckff` `author:unclejim21` `author:cmdruid`

This NIP defines `kind:31402` (a _parameterized replaceable event_) for broadcasting API services, endpoints and their costs in mSats. API services are offered ala carte to be paid via lnurl type invoices.

API service providers will issue a `kind:31402` event as an API service offering. Clients can fetch `s` (service) tag offerings, call their endpoints, and pay per use. Creating an API service marketplace.

## Protocol flow

1. API Service provider creates and hosts API service offerings, they then issue a `kind:31402` event for each `s` tag.
2. Client fetches API offerings by `s` tag.
3. Client chooses a provider(s) and POSTs to their `endpoint`. In the Post body:
   1.  In the POST body: `api` shall contain all data needed for the API request
   2.  In the POST body: `nostr` shall contain a `kind:9734` zap request
4. The service provider should validate their request and return a lightning invoice with a `successAction` url.
   1. The `successAction` url should be uniquely ID'd with the invoice hash.
   2. The `successAction` url should be formatted as such: `<endpoint>/<invoice_hash>/get_result`
5. The client pays.
   1. The client will poll the `successAction` until the service provider has posted the result(s).
   2. The results should include a `kind:9734` zap receipt.
   3. The service provider may choose to publish the `kind:9734` zap receipt.

## Server Functions
Each `kind:31402`'s `endpoint` should feild two functions. `create_invoice`, and `get_results`. For the following sections assume we are given the following `endpoint`: `https://example.api/chat/`

### Create Invoice

Initally, the client will make a POST request to the `endpoint`. The POST body should contain two objects: `api` and `nostr`.

- `api` shall contain all of the data formatted for the actual API request
- `nostr` shall contain the `kind:9734` zap request of the transaction. 

The service provider will then do the following:

1. Validate their API request
2. Stage the zap request for posting
3. Issue a lightning invoice

The issued lightning invoice will contain a `successAction` url formatted as so:

`<endpoint>/<invoice_hash>/get_result`

for example: 

`https://example.api/chat/<invoice_hash>/get_result`

From here the service provider can either listen and execute their API request "on-payment" or wait until the client calls `get_results`.

### Get Results

Once the client has gotten the `successAction` url, they can issue a GET request. The service provider should respond in one of three ways:

1. Success - the service provider returns the results of the API as if it was coming from the product itself
2. Not Ready - the service provider returns a status that indicates the results are not ready yet
3. 402 - the service provider should respond with a 402 error if they client has not paid yet

The service provider should keep the resulting data persistent until after the client has used it. Once the client has retreived the data successfully, the service provider should post the `kind:9734` zap request of the transaction.

## Event Reference and Examples

### Format ( Service Tag )

The `s` (service) tag should simply be the full name of the API service provided. To standardize the offerings, the following should be followed for posting and parsing.

- All letters should be UPPER CASE.
- Spaces, Hyphens, Underscores should be removed.
- Names should be spelled out completely
  
For example, "Chat-GPT3.5", should result in "CHATGPT3.5" See **Sample Services**.

### Offering Event

`kind:31402`

`.content` could be empty or have an optional description.

For the date of the last update the `.created_at` field should be used.

`.tag` MUST include the following:

- `s`, the service offered, see **Format ( Service Tag )**
- `d`, following **parameterized replaceable events** in [NIP-01](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/01.md), this tag allows this event to be replaceable. It should be formatted as such: `<pubkey><service>`
- `amount`, the cost in _millisats_ for the API service. This can be 0 for a free service.
- `endpoint`, the API endpoint.
- `docs`, the documentation url to provide context to what the endpoint is expecting.
- `status`, status of the service `UP`|`DOWN`|`CLOSED`.
- `published_at`, for the timestamp in unix seconds (stringified) of the first time the service was posted

### Zap Receipt

`kind:9734`

Should largely follow the [NIP-57](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/01.md) when creating the zap receipt.

`.content` should be "Zap!"

`.tag` MUST include the following:

- `amount`, the cost in _millisats_ for the API service. This can be 0 for a free service.
- `p`, the pubkey of the service provider.
- `e`, the service offering event.
- `s`, the service.

### Safey

It is not manditory, but to raise the barrier to entry, clients should screen service provider's NIP-05 identifier. The domain used in their NIP-05, should be the same domain used for their endpoint.

Clients may wish to create a whitelist of trusted service providers once tested.

Clients may wish to randomly test the reviews for a given service to ensure 

### Example Service Event

```json
{
  "kind": 31402,
  "created_at": 1675642635, // Changes on update
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["s", "CHATGPT4"]
    ["d", "<pubkey>CHATGPT4"],
    ["amount", "5000"] //mSats
    ["endpoint", "https://..."],
    ["docs", "https://..."],
    ["status", "UP"], //UP | DOWN | CLOSED
    ["published_at", 1675642635], // Set on published
  ],
  "pubkey": "...",
  "id": "..."
}
```

### Example Service POST

```json
{
    "api": { ... } // API Payload
    "nostr": { ... } // Zap Reciept 
}
```
### Example Zap Receipt

```json
{
  "kind": 9734,
  "content": "Zap!",
  "tags": [
    ["relays", "wss://nostr-pub.wellorder.com"],
    ["amount", "21000"],
    ["p", "..."], // Pubkey of the Event Creator
    ["e", "..."], // Service Offering Event
    ["s", "..."] 
  ],
  "pubkey": "97c70a44366a6535c145b333f973ea86dfdc2d7a99da618c40c64705ad98e322",
  "created_at": 1679673265,

}

### Sample Services

| Service            |
| ------------------ |
| `CHATGPT4`         |
| `CHATGPT3.5`       |
| `DALLE`            |
| `STABLEDIFFUSION`  |
| `WHISPER`          |

### Problems
- No data integrety - service providers can store/redistrubte any data passed to them
- Service providers could take payment and never return the product
